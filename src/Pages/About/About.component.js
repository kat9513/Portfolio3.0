                                I am a highly creative and driven individual dedicated to learning new skills and advancing towards constant improvement and innovation. In 2019 I completed SMUâ€™s Coding Bootcamp where I developed skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Express, React, MySQL, and MongoDB. In addition to my training in illustration and digital graphics, I am also an experienced content writer and customer service provider.

                                I am particularly interested in how technology is a fundamental aspect of our personal and professional lives, and how it impacts the ways we interact with and understand our world and each other on a daily basis. Based on my experience, professional drive, and ability to develop functional code/websites I look forward to making an impact and help grow a company.
