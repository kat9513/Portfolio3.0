                                I am a highly creative and driven individual dedicated to learning new skills and pushing for improvement.
                                In 2019 I completed SMUâ€™s Coding Bootcamp where I developed skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Express, React, MySQL, and MongoDB.
                                In addition to my training in illustration and digital graphics, I am also an experienced content writer and customer service provider.

                                I am particularly interested in how technology is a fundamental aspect of our personal and professional lives, and how new tech (particularly augmented and virtual reality) impacts the ways we interact with and understand our world and each other on a daily basis.
